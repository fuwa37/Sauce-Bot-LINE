# Roboragi
Roboragi is a Reddit bot (found at [/u/Roboragi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Roboragi/) which creates anime and manga links from MAL, Hummingbird, Anilist, MangaUpdates and Anime-Planet when requested.

## Technical info
Roboragi is written in Python for use with Python 3. There's a requirements.txt if you want to test it out yourself, but you'll need to create a Config.py with your own information and set up a PostgreSQL database. I **highly** recommend changing the subredditlist variable in AnimeBot.py to a private subreddit that only you and the bot have access to (otherwise you'll respond to everything the actual Roboragi bot does).

## How it works
Roboragi uses PRAW (a Python library) to interface with Reddit through the /u/Roboragi account. It searches through constant stream of comments and checks each of those for requests for the correct symbols - {}, {{}}, <> and <<>>. Once it's identified that it's being called, it takes the stuff between the braces and does a search for it in various anime/manga databases. Once it's got as much as it can find, the objects generated by the various databases are sent off to be formed into a comment. That then gets sent back to Reddit to be commented through PRAW and /u/Roboragi.
